# Frontend Learning Dashboard
A dashboard app to house frontend experiments for innovation time. Mainly using this as a place to learn and try new technologies I've been interested in. 

## Pages

### Tram app
A simple tram station departure app which uses the Transport for Great for Manchester API https://developer.tfgm.com/.
Uses Google Maps API to render map. Note that a valid key is required for this to work in .env.

### Babylon JS experiments
Used react-babylonjs to render up a quick 3d canvas using React declarations.
Created 3d Particle engine with UI
